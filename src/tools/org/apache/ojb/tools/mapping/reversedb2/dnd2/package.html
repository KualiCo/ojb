  This package contains infrastructure that should make it easier to implement
Drag and Drop in GUIs with JDKs 1.2 and 1.3. These classes do most of the
event handling for you. If you are a Dnd "provider" you have to implement
a Transferable to take the data you want to export and an implementation of 
DragCopyCutWorker interface. Basically what you have to do is to read the data
from your model and put it into an transferable.

If you are a DnD "consumer", you have to implement a DropPastWorkerInterface
that accepts at least on flavour of Transferable data and inserts it into the
model.

In this package there is still a lot room for improvements, but it should be 
good enough to help you implementing basic DnD (and Clipboard) functionality#
in your application.
