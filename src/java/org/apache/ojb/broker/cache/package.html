<p>
This package provides classes for caching of objects materialized from a datastore.
</p>

<p>
Applications use the ObjectCacheFactory to create new ObjectCaches.
These caches supply methods for storing and retrieving objects.
Objects can be looked up by their identity which is represented by the class Identiy.
Each implementation of ObjectCache represents a different caching strategy.
