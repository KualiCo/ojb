            Status reports for the different APIs in Apache OJB.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any known issues, including for the parts of OJB that are <em>stable</em>,
            can be found in <a href="ext:release-notes">release-notes.txt</a>.

                <p>
                    The PB (Persistence Broker) API implementation is <strong>stable</strong>.

                    The ODMG API implementation is <strong>stable</strong>.
                </p>
                <note>
                    OQL is currently not
                    fully implemented (Aggregations and Method Invocations). Workaround is to use
                    the <em>PB-API</em> <a href="site:odmg-guide/no-oql">within the ODMG implementation</a>.

                <p>
                    By providing a plugin to the SUN JDO Reference Implementation we provide
                    a complete JDO 1.0.1 <em>prototype</em> O/R mapping tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integration in managed environments (in particular JTA integration)
                    is not supported for the JDO 1.0 prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A complete Apache licensed JDO 2.0 implementation is scheduled for OJB 2.0.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The OTM (Object Transaction Manager) API implementation is in
                    <em>early beta</em>.
                </p>
                <note>
                    The active development on the OTM API implementation is currently
                    stopped due to lack of developer resources in that area.
                    The future of the OTM layer will be discussed on the
                    <a href="site:mail-lists">OJB developer mailing list</a>.

                <p>
                    The legacy S.O.D.A. (Simple Object Database Access) API should
                    be considered <em>deprecated</em> and might be removed in a future
                    release.
