            <p>
                Building an Object/Relational mapping tool with support for multiple API's
                is really error prone. To create a solid and stable software, the most awful thing in
                programmers life has to be done - Testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quality assurance taken seriously! OJB and provide specific tests for each
                supported API. Currently more than 800 test cases for regression tests exist.
                As testing framework
                <a href="ext:junit">JUnit</a> was used.

                <title>Where can I find the test sources?</title>
                <p>
                    The test sources of the <em>OJB Test-Suite</em> can be find under
                    <strong><code>[db-ojb]/src/test/org/apache/ojb</code></strong>.
                    <br/>
                    It's also possible to browse the test sources online using the
                    <a href="ext:cvs-index"><em>apache cvs view</em></a>. The test directory can be found here:
                    <a href="ext:cvs-view-tests"><strong><code>[db-ojb]/src/test/org/apache/ojb</code></strong></a>.

            <title>How to run the Test Suite</title>
            <p>
                If the
                <a href="site:platform">platform depended settings</a> are done, the test suite
                can be started with the ant target:
            </p>
            <source><![CDATA[
ant junit]]></source>
            <p>
                If compiling of the sources should be skipped use
                </p>
     <source><![CDATA[
ant junit-no-compile]]></source>
            <p>
                If you did not manage to set up the target database with the
                <code>ant prepare-testdb</code> you can use
                </p>
                <source><![CDATA[
ant junit-no-compile-no-prepare]]></source>
            <p>
            to run the testsuite without generation of the test database
                (and without compiling).
            </p>
            <p>
                After running the regression tests
                you should see a console output similar to this:

            <p>
                We aim at shipping that releases have no failures and errors in the regression tests!
                If the Junit tests report errors or failures something does not
                work properly! There may be several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You made a mistake in configuration (OJB was shipped with settings pass all tests).
                    See <a href="site:platform">platform</a>,
                    <a href="site:ojb-properties">OJB.properties</a>,
                    <a href="site:repository">repository file</a>,
                    <a href="site:jdbc-types"></a>.
                </li>
                <li>Your database doesn't support specific features used by the tests</li>
                <li>Evil hex</li>
                <li>Bug in OJB</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                JUnit writes a <em>log-file</em> for each tested API. You can find the logs
                under <code>[db-ojb]/target/test</code>. The log files named like <code>tests-XXX.txt</code>.
                The test logs show in detail what's going wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                In such a case please check again if you followed all the above
                steps. If you still have problems you might post a request to
                the OJB user mailinglist.

                <title>How to run the test-suite with a different database than OJB default DB</title>
                <p>
                    Basically all you have to do is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get source version of OJB or fetch OJB from CVS (take care of
                        branches, branch OJB_1_0_RELEASE represents OJB 1.0.x).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adapt the profile file of your database under
                        <code>[db-ojb]/profile/yourDB.profile</code> and set user, password, ...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In <code>[db-ojb]/build.properties</code> file comment the
                        "profile=hsqldb" line and uncomment the "#profile=yourDB" line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drop jdo.jar and your database driver into
                        <code>[db-ojb]/lib</code> directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drop <em>junit.jar</em> into your <code>...ant/lib</code> folder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that your database allows at least 20 concurrent connections.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Then follow the steps described <a href="#run-test-suite">above</a>.

                All major known issues are listed in the <a href="ext:ojb/release-notes">release-notes</a>

                The tests reproduce open bugs will be skipped on released OJB versions. It is possible to enable
                these tests to see all failing test cases of the shipped version by changing a
                flag in <code>[db-ojb]/build.properties</code> file:
